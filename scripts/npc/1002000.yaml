    - message: "Do you wanna head over to some other town? With a little money involved, I can make it happen. It's a tad expensive, but I run a special 90% discount for beginners."
    - message: "The town you are at is {map}! Alright I'll explain to you more about {map}. It's the place you landed on Victoria Island by riding The Victoria. That's Lith Harbor. A lot of beginners who just got here from Maple Island start their journey here."
      params:
              - map: 104000000 # Lith Harbor
    - message: "It's a quiet town with the wide body of water on the back of it, thanks to the fact that the harbor is located at the west end of the island. Most of the people here are, or used to be fisherman, so they may look intimidating, but if you strike up a conversation with them, they'll be friendly to you."
    - message: "Around town lies a beautiful prairie. Most of the monsters there are small and gentle, perfect for beginners. If you haven't chosen your job yet, this is a good place to boost up your level."
    - message: "Alright I'll explain to you more about {map}. It's a warrior-town located at the northern-most part of Victoria Island, surrounded by rocky mountains. With an unfriendly atmosphere, only the strong survives there."

    - message: "Around the highland you'll find a really skinny tree, a wild hog running around the place, and monkeys that live all over the island. There's also a deep valley, and when you go deep into it, you'll find a humongous dragon with the power to match his size. Better go in there very carefully, or don't go at all."
    - message: "If you want to be a {job} then find {npc}, the chief of Perion. If you're level 10 or higher, along with a good STR level, he may make you a warrior after all. If not, better keep training yourself until you reach that level."

    - message: "Alright I'll explain to you more about {map}. It's a magician-town located at the far east of Victoria Island, and covered in tall, mystic trees. You'll find some fairies there, too. They don't like humans in general so it'll be best for you to be on their good side and stay quiet."

    - message: "Near the forest you'll find green slimes, walking mushrooms, monkeys and zombie monkeys all residing there. Walk deeper into the forest and you'll find witches with the flying broomstick navigating the skies. A word of warning: Unless you are really strong, I recommend you don't go near them."
    - message: "If you want to be a {job}, search for {npc}, the head wizard of {map}. He may make you a wizard if you're at or above level 8 with a decent amount of INT. If that's not the case, you may have to hunt more and train yourself to get there."

The weather's just right, and everything is plentiful around that town, perfect for living. Go check it out."

    - message: "Around the prairie you'll find weak monsters such as snails, mushrooms, and pigs. According to what I hear, though, in the deepest part of the Pig Park, which is connected to the town somewhere, you'll find a humongous, powerful mushroom called Mushmom every now and then."
    - message: "If you want to be a {job}, you need to go see {npc} at {map}. With a level at or above 10 and a decent amount of DEX, she may make you be one afterall. If not, go train yourself, make yourself stronger, then try again."

It's a thief-town located at the northwest part of Victoria Island, and there are buildings up there that have just this strange feeling around them. It's mostly covered in black clouds, but if you can go up to a really high place, you'll be able to see a very beautiful sunset there."

There's a hotel there, so you can rest up after a long day at the dungeon ... it's a quiet town in general."
      params:

    - message: "In front of the hotel there's an old buddhist monk by the name of {npc}. Nobody knows a thing about that monk. Apparently he collects materials from the travelers and create something, but I am not too sure about the details. If you have any business going around that area, please check that out for me."

          - npc: "Chrishrama"
    - message: "From {map}, head east and you'll find the ant tunnel connected to the deepest part of the Victoria Island. Lots of nasty, powerful monsters abound so if you walk in thinking it's a walk in the park, you'll be coming out as a corpse. You need to fully prepare yourself for a rough ride before going in."
